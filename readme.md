# High Level Planner WebApp

A Django web application that combines:
- A **base prompt** (context)
- A **text prompt** (query)
- An **image upload** (PNG/JPG)

All inputs are sent to **VLM or VLA** to generate a response called **ü§ñ Robot Action**.  
The uploaded image is previewed both **before submission** and **after submission**.

  - **Left**: Prompt + Text Prompt + Image upload + Submit button
  - **Right**: Image Preview + Robot Action output
- Client-side preview of uploaded image (before submission)
